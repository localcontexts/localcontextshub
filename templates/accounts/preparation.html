            <p class="bold">
                Please note the following before creating a community account:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>01 A community account is for a sovereign collective Indigenous or local community group who will use Labels. </strong> 
                This includes a Nation, First Nation, Iwi, Band, Tribe, Confederation, Land Council, Native Hawaiian Organization, and Alaskan Native Village Corporation. 
                A community account can customize and apply Traditional Knowledge and Biocultural Labels on behalf of their community.
                <br><br>   

                <strong>02 As the creator of this new account, you will become the account contact by default.  </strong>
                You will be the main administrator and the point of contact for the account. If you would like to change the account 
                contact or your role after creating your account, please contact us.
                <br><br> 

                <strong>03 In order to confirm your account, we will ask for the contact information for a community representative or a letter outlining their approval.</strong>
                Since this account will represent your community on the Hub, we ask to confirm the account with a community representative who has the responsibility 
                for approving community initiatives.
                <br><br> 

                We will ask for the representativeâ€™s name and email, or you may upload a signed letter outlining their approval to join the Hub. The contact information or 
                letter is needed in order to create a new account. Until the account is confirmed, certain features will not be available. This confirmation must be completed 
                within 90 days, or the incomplete account will be removed.

                Please note the following before creating an institution account:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. An institution account is for a cultural or research institution, data repository, or other organization that will use Notices.</strong> 
                An archive, library, museum, historical society, gallery, data repository, university, research lab, or media production company might create an institution account. 
                This account will represent your organization on the Hub and potentially in relationships with sovereign Indigenous communities. If you are an Indigenous institution 
                and plan to use Labels on behalf of your community, a community account may be a better fit. Please <a class="default-a" href="mailto:support@localcontexts.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact us</a> if you have any questions.
                <br><br>

                <strong>2. As the creator of this new account, you will become the main administrator by default. </strong>
                As the main administrator, you will be the point of contact for the account and responsible for adding other users to the account. If you would like to change the 
                account contact or your role after creating your account, please <a class="default-a" href="mailto:support@localcontexts.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact us</a>.
                <br><br>

                <strong>3. A subscription program for institution accounts will be launched in October 2024.</strong>
                More information about this program is available on our 
                <a class="default-a" href="https://localcontexts.org/generational-sustainability-of-local-contexts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website blog</a> 
                and <a class="default-a" href="https://localcontexts.org/members-subscribers-and-service-providers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscribers page</a>. 
                After you complete the institution account creation process, you will have 
                limited account functionality until completion of the subscription agreement. We will reach out to you, and any institutional contacts you indicate, to discuss which 
                subscription tier is best for your organization. If we do not hear from you within 90 days, this incomplete account will be deleted.

            <p>
                <strong>1. A researcher account is for an individual who carries out academic or scientific research independently or in an institution and who will use Notices.</strong> 
                Researcher accounts are only for one user. This account will represent you on the Hub and potentially in relationships with sovereign Indigenous communities.
